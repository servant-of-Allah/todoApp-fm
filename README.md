## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

this project helpend improve my React knowledge. Additionally i used the react-beautiful-dnd library for adding drag and drop functionality for the first time. it was a great experience. i got to learn about it's usage. the filtering section and conditional rendering helped too to deepen my understanding of them. i did not use any css library or framework. i wanted to improve and challenge my css skill too. and it did. overall i learnt many things along the way i didn't know before even if it's small.

### Continued development

in future i have the the intention to add the functionality to remember the users todos using localstorage. but for now i leave it here.

### Useful resources

-[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) how can i not mention this platform... -[Openbase](https://openbase.com) the tutorial on react-beautiful-dnd on openbase helped me greatly.
